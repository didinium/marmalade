**Marmalade** - Music Transcription

Message to Maintainers/Commiters:
*  Please fork the [master repository](http://github.com/didinium/marmalade) and do edits/testing on the fork
*  Direct edits to the master repo are discouraged - please edit your own repo and submit a PR
*  You are (technically) allowed to resolve your own PRs, but let someone look over it first, if possible
*  Please don't merge untested/unstable code into the main repo
*  Please don't make edits that fix a lot (e.g. 50) of files, since it will make merging with other people's work a hassle
*  There is a *dev-testing* branch on the master. The repo's owner (should) use this to keep his edits/testing from cluttering the master branch
*  Be aware of what others are doing. It will prevent duplication of code and will keep the merging process simple and painless
